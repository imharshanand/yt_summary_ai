# YouTube Video Transcript Summarizer

## Project Overview

The YouTube Video Transcript Summarizer is a Python-based tool that extracts transcripts from YouTube videos and summarizes them using a pre-trained T5 model. The project leverages several powerful libraries and APIs to perform these tasks efficiently, making it easier to get concise summaries of lengthy video content.

## Key Features

- **YouTube API Integration**: Fetches the latest videos or specific video transcripts from a YouTube channel using the YouTube Data API.
- **Transcript Extraction**: Retrieves transcripts of YouTube videos using the `youtube-transcript-api`.
- **Summarization with T5 Model**: Uses the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model from the Hugging Face Transformers library to summarize the extracted transcripts.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes NVIDIA GPUs for faster model inference if available.

## Project Structure

- **Model Setup**: The project downloads and saves the T5 model and tokenizer locally for reuse, minimizing the need to redownload the model.
- **Text Processing**: Includes functions for cleaning and preparing transcript text to ensure high-quality input for the summarization model.
- **Summarization**: Implements a function to generate summaries using the T5 model, which condenses the content of the transcripts into concise summaries.

## Detailed Description

### What We Did

1. **API Integration**:
   - Integrated the YouTube Data API to fetch video details and transcripts.
   - Utilized `youtube-transcript-api` to extract video transcripts.

2. **Model Utilization**:
   - Employed the T5 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library for text summarization.
   - Saved the model and tokenizer locally to avoid redundant downloads and improve efficiency.

3. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensured compatibility with both GPU and CPU for model inference.
   - Provided detailed instructions for setting up the required environment and dependencies.

4. **Summarization Pipeline**:
   - Implemented a text processing pipeline to clean and prepare transcripts for summarization.
   - Developed a summarization function that generates concise summaries of the transcripts.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - Allowed users to input a YouTube video URL to get the summary of the video transcript.
   - Provided clear and detailed output, including the extracted video ID, transcript, and the generated summary.

## Installation

To set up the project, you need to install the required libraries. Use the following commands:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install torch
pip install google-api-python-client
pip install youtube-transcript-api
```
